    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <hr />
    <br/><p class="about">I’m **M. Venkatesh**, a passionate web developer driven by the endless possibilities of the digital world. Crafting seamless, responsive, and user-centric websites isn’t just what I do — it’s what I love.  
        
        From the first line of code to the final product, I thrive on turning ideas into interactive, functional web experiences. Whether it’s building from scratch or optimizing existing systems, I focus on clean code, modern design, and performance.  
        
        My journey in web development has been fueled by curiosity and a deep desire to create. I’m constantly learning, evolving, and staying on top of the latest trends and technologies — because in this ever-changing field, growth is everything.  
        
        For me, the web isn’t just a platform — it’s a canvas, and I’m here to build, innovate, and inspire through it.  
        
        Let’s code the future, one project at a time.

        <h2>Beyond my passion for technology</h2>
        <p class="technology">
I enjoy engaging in sports like badminton and cricket, which keep me active and mentally refreshed. These games help build focus, discipline, and teamwork. I also value spending quality time with family and friends, believing strong relationships are key to a balanced and fulfilling life. Whether it’s a friendly match or a casual get-together, I cherish these moments. Additionally, I have a helping nature and always try to support those around me, whether personally or professionally. These aspects of my life reflect my belief in staying grounded, positive, and connected with people.
